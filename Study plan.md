# Week one(Start of minor project)
## Day one(Introduction to programming)
This section is purely to get you start with programming and understanding of what programming is. It will cover general understanding and no particular programming language.

Watch these videos as your learning resource
[Introduction to Programming and Computer Science - Full Course (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOjov-2OZ0E)

#### Lab
You will write answers to the questions below. This is open book but if you can answer from simply watching the video above.
```
- What is the difference between a high level and low level programming language?
- What are some popular programming languages?
- Besides codingbat, coderbyte and hackerrank, are there other websites where you can practice your coding skills?
- What are some data structures?
- What is game design?
- What is data science?
- Besides taking classes in high school, what other ways are there to learn programming?
```
## Day two(Linux & Git)
In for the next two days, you will get to interact with Linux and Git
What is Linux and git
***Linux***: 



For learn linux and hands on experience, you will install WSL on windows to access a linux machine from your windows machine. [Install WSL | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)  

You will open command prompt and run the command below to install Ubuntu. (Use a fast and stable internet connection, unlimited cable internet preferably)
```bash
wsl --install
```
Follow the instructions and once its done, you will use the installed linux to learn and practice with linux.

Here are the resources to help you understand linux(Ubuntu) and git
[Linux Essentials - Beginner Crash Course (Ubuntu) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_2jPbQornY)
[60 Linux Commands you NEED to know (in 10 minutes) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd7BXuUQ91w)
[Git and GitHub for Beginners - Crash Course - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk)

Watch and follow along on these videos. Trying out what you see.
Also install [Visual Studio Code - Code Editing. Redefined](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

#### Lab
In todays you will carry out the following tasks. Ensure you have watched the advised content above. 
Carry out the tasks below;
- Create a linux user called learning
- Create a directory named `projects` in the home directory of learning
- Add the text below in a file named `learning` in the `projects` directory

**The Impact of Technology on Modern Education**

In the past few decades, technology has revolutionized almost every aspect of our lives, and education is no exception. The integration of technology into the classroom has significantly transformed the teaching and learning processes, providing new opportunities and challenges. The digital age has brought about a paradigm shift in education, moving from traditional methods to more innovative, engaging, and interactive approaches.

One of the most notable impacts of technology on education is the accessibility of information. The internet has made a vast amount of information available at the fingertips of students and educators alike. Online resources such as e-books, academic journals, and educational websites provide a wealth of knowledge that was previously inaccessible to many. This democratization of information allows students from different geographical locations and economic backgrounds to access high-quality educational materials, thereby promoting equality in education.

Moreover, technology has facilitated the rise of online learning platforms and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Platforms like Coursera, edX, and Khan Academy offer courses from prestigious universities and institutions around the world. These platforms provide flexible learning opportunities, enabling students to learn at their own pace and convenience. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for adult learners and working professionals who wish to continue their education without disrupting their careers.

In addition to accessibility and flexibility, technology has also enhanced the interactivity and engagement in the learning process. Interactive tools such as smartboards, virtual labs, and educational apps make learning more engaging and enjoyable. These tools cater to different learning styles and preferences, allowing for a more personalized learning experience. For instance, visual learners can benefit from multimedia presentations, while kinesthetic learners can engage with interactive simulations and experiments.

Furthermore, technology has revolutionized the way educators teach and assess students. Digital tools such as learning management systems (LMS), online quizzes, and e-portfolios provide educators with efficient ways to manage course materials, track student progress, and provide feedback. These tools not only save time but also enable more accurate and comprehensive assessment of student performance. Additionally, the use of data analytics in education allows for the identification of learning patterns and the customization of teaching strategies to meet individual student needs.

However, the integration of technology in education is not without its challenges. One of the primary concerns is the digital divide, which refers to the gap between individuals who have access to technology and those who do not. This divide can exacerbate existing inequalities in education, as students without access to digital devices and the internet may be left behind. Addressing this issue requires concerted efforts from governments, educational institutions, and private organizations to ensure that all students have access to the necessary technological resources.

Another challenge is the potential for technology to be a distraction in the classroom. With the proliferation of smartphones and social media, students may find it difficult to stay focused on their studies. Educators need to develop strategies to manage technology use in the classroom and ensure that it enhances rather than hinders the learning process.

In conclusion, technology has had a profound impact on modern education, providing numerous benefits such as increased accessibility, flexibility, interactivity, and efficiency. However, it also presents challenges that need to be addressed to fully realize its potential. As technology continues to evolve, it is essential for educators, policymakers, and stakeholders to collaborate and develop innovative solutions that harness the power of technology to improve educational outcomes for all students.

Once you are done with the lab, run the history command, take a screenshot and submit your answer to the github repository.
## Day three(Docker and more Git)
Day three you will build on your understanding of linux and learn Docker, docker images and docker compose.

Docker is used to run applications on any machine and ensuring that all configurations are the same.

[Docker Compose will BLOW your MIND!! (a tutorial) (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DM65_JyGxCo)

#### Lab
Follow the instructions in the github repository here: [searxng/searxng-docker: The docker-compose files for setting up a SearXNG instance with docker. (github.com)](https://github.com/searxng/searxng-docker)

You are to deploy your own meta search engine using docker and run it on your local installation of linux. Follow the instructions on the readme file.

**Tips**
Since you don't have a domain, in place of hostname just use localhost
